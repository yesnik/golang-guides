# Slices

An array has a fixed size. A *slice* is a dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array. 
In practice, slices are much more common than arrays.

```go
nums := [6]int{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12} // array

var s []int = nums[2:4] // create slice
fmt.Println(s) // [6 8]

letters := []string{"A", "B"}
fmt.Println(letters) // [A B]
```
