# Structs

*Struct* in Golang is a user-defined type that allows to group/combine items of possibly different types into a single type. 
Any real-world entity which has some set of properties/fields can be represented as a struct. 

Struct fields are accessed using a dot.

```go
type Address struct {
	city       string
	street     string
	homeNumber int
}

func main() {
	a := Address{city: "Moscow", street: "Lenina", HomeNumber: 1}
	fmt.Println(a) // {Moscow Lenina 1}

	// We can initialize a variable of a struct type using a struct literal
	b := Address{"NY", "Yellow", 2}
	fmt.Println(b)            // {NY Yellow 2}
	fmt.Println(b.city)       // NY
	fmt.Println(b.street)     // Yellow
	fmt.Println(b.HomeNumber) // 2
}
```
The `type` keyword introduces a new type. 
It is followed by the name of the type (`Address`) and the keyword `struct` to illustrate that weâ€™re defining a struct. 
The struct contains a list of various fields inside the curly braces. Each field has a name and a type.

We can also make struct compact by combining the various fields of the same type:

```go
type Address struct {
	city, street string
	HomeNumber   int
}
```

## Struct Literals

A struct literal is a newly allocated struct value.

You can list just a subset of fields in *any order* by using the `X: 123` syntax.

The `&` returns a pointer to the struct value.

```go
type Vertex struct {
	X, Y int
}

var (
	v1 = Vertex{1, 2}  // has type Vertex
	v2 = Vertex{Y: 3}  // X:0 is implicit
	v3 = Vertex{}      // X:0 and Y:0
	p  = &Vertex{4, 5} // has type *Vertex
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(v1, v2, v3, p) // {1 2} {0 3} {0 0} &{4 5}
}
```
