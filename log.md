# Log

## Info log

Use `log.New()` to create a logger for writing information messages. 
This takes 3 parameters: 

- the destination to write the logs to (os.Stdout),
- a string prefix for message (INFO followed by a tab)
- flags to indicate what additional information to include (local date and time). Note that the flags are joined using the bitwise `OR` operator `|`.

```go
infoLog := log.New(os.Stdout, "INFO\t", log.Ldate|log.Ltime)
```

## Error log

Create a logger for writing error messages in the same way, but use `stderr` as the destination and use the `log.Llongfile` flag to include the relevant file name and line number.

```go
errorLog := log.New(os.Stderr, "ERROR\t", log.Ldate|log.Ltime|log.Llongfile)
```
