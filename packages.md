# Packages

Go allows us to define our own packages. 

**A package** is a group of code that all does similar things:

- the `fmt` package formats output
- the `math` package works with numbers
- the `strings` package works with strings

Being able to use the same code between programs is one of the major reasons packages exist.

If parts of your code are shared between multiple programs, you should consider moving them into packages.
