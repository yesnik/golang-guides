# Mutex

What if we just want to make sure only one goroutine can access a variable at a time to avoid conflicts?

This concept is called *mutual exclusion*, and the conventional name for the data structure that provides it is **mutex**.

Go's standard library provides mutual exclusion with `sync.Mutex` and its two methods: Lock, Unlock.

We can define a block of code to be executed in mutual exclusion by surrounding it with a call to `Lock` and `Unlock` as shown on the `Inc` method.

We can also use `defer` to ensure the mutex will be unlocked as in the `Value` method.

```go

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

// SafeCounter is safe to use concurrently.
type SafeCounter struct {
	mu sync.Mutex
	v  map[string]int
}

// Inc increments the counter for the given key.
func (c *SafeCounter) Inc(key string) {
	c.mu.Lock()
	// Lock so only one goroutine at a time can access the map c.v.
	c.v[key]++
	c.mu.Unlock()
}

// Value returns the current value of the counter for the given key.
func (c *SafeCounter) Value(key string) int {
	c.mu.Lock()
	// Lock so only one goroutine at a time can access the map c.v.
	defer c.mu.Unlock()
	return c.v[key]
}

func main() {
	c := SafeCounter{v: make(map[string]int)}
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		go c.Inc("somekey")
	}

	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	fmt.Println(c.Value("somekey")) // 10
}
```
